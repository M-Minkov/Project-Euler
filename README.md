# ProjectEulerSolutions
Collection of project euler problems I've solved.

Some problems containing different methods, and implemented in different languages.

Generally I like to solve the problems using Python, or sometimes just by hand if they're small enough.
I usually show how a method works using drawn diagrams, and then implement it into code.
